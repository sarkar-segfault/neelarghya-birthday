# Happy Birthday, Neelarghya!
Congratulations on reaching yet another full rotation of this godforsaken planet around its indifferent star! As you transition from the dome of comfort that is childhood into the depressing world of adults, you will encounter horrors and wonders both amazing and terrifying, like property tax and staying up all night. But none of these will compare to the sights and sounds you will experience the rest of your life, which you will remember in a dreamy state decades later, provided you live long enough. Rejoice, or maybe sulk, for you have exited the carefree days of childhood, and are now forced by both your physical body and societal pressure to settle into the world beyond. 

But if this ever becomes too much for you, maybe grab a hajmola.
